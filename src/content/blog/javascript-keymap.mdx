# JavaScript Pressed-Key Store

This is a small snippet to save pressed keys in an object.

```js
window.addEventListener("keydown", keydown);
window.addEventListener("keyup", keyup);

let keys = {};

function keydown(ev) {
  keys[ev.code] = true;
}
function keyup(ev) {
  delete keys[ev.code];
}
```

Then use it like:

```js
if (keys["ShiftLeft"] && keys["KeyM"]) {
  doMagic();
}
```

## Try it out

Pressed keys:

<Keymap1 />
